Here you will find the SumoRobot library and it's arduino files.

To get started you will first need to have the Arduino IDE downloaded and installed.
Then you will have to go too the library manager and install the ZumoShield library.
You can then download the files from this github page.

When the files are downloaded you will need open the SumoLib folder.
In the SumoLib folder there is two more folders. Open ArduinoSumoCode folder. Then open the ArduinoSumoCode.ino.
